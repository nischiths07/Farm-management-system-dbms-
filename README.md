# 🌾 Farm Management System – DBMS Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The Farm Management System is a database-driven application designed to manage agricultural activities efficiently.  
This project focuses on organizing farm-related data such as crops, farmers, inventory, sales, and transactions using a structured relational database model.

It is developed as part of a DBMS academic project.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To design a structured relational database for farm operations.
- To manage crop production and inventory records.
- To track farmer details and transactions.
- To demonstrate SQL concepts such as:
  - Table creation
  - Primary & Foreign Keys
  - Joins
  - Constraints
  - Queries
  - Stored Procedures / Triggers 

---

## 🗂️ Database Structure

The system may include the following tables:

- `Farmers`
- `Crops`
- `Inventory`
- `Sales`
- `Suppliers`
- `Orders`
- `Payments`

(Relationships are maintained using Primary and Foreign Keys.)

- MySQL Workbench
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📊 Features

- Add and manage farmer records
- Track crop production details
- Manage inventory stock
- Record sales transactions
- Generate reports using SQL queries

---

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

- Entity Relationship Model (ER Model)
- Normalization
- Relational Schema Design
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE farm_management;
   ```
3. Use the database:
   ```sql
   USE farm_management;
   ```
4. Run the SQL script file provided in this repository.
5. Execute queries to test the system.
